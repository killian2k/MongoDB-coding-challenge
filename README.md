# MongoDB-coding-challenge

Here is my solution for the coding challenge

## Run the program

The program can be used with the command:

```shell
cat PATH_TO_FILE.json | python3 program_mongo_db_json.py
```

when the terminal is the same folder as program_mongo_db_json.py.

## Add new test files

It is also possible to add new json files by adding putting two files in the folder "test_files". One with the prefix "test_" that is the input for the program and a solution with the same file name but with the prefix "s_" instead. (all without the quotes).

To run the file that do check all the json test files in the "test_files" folder, just run the command:

```shell
python3 testing_program.py
```

when the terminal is the same folder as testing_program.py.

## Other infos

I kept the program simple without adding specific features as it was not required.
