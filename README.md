# MongoDB-coding-challenge

Here is my solution for the coding challenge

The program can be used with the command:

'''cat PATH_TO_FILE.json | python3 program_mongo_db_json.py'''

when the terminal is the same folder as program_mongo_db_json.py.


It is also possible to add new json files by adding it in the folder "test_files" with the prefix "test_" and a soluction with the same file but with the prefix "s_" (without the quotes)


To run the file that do check all the json test files in the "test_files" folder, just run the command:

'''python3 testing_program.py'''

I kept the program simple without adding specific features as it was not required.
